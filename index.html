	<! -- Brief About Me --> 
	<p style="font-style:italic;"> Stay tuned for updates <p>			<p> I am a Ph.D. candidate at Yale University working on software and data analysis for the Simons Observatory, a new Cosmic Microwave Background observatory in the Atacama Desert in Chile. My graduate research is supervised by <a href="https://physics.yale.edu/people/laura-newburgh">Laura Newburgh</a>.<p>
<p> I am also very interested in education and STEM outreach, especially equitable classroom and course design. I co-developed the curriculum for the Yale <a href="https://physics.yale.edu/academics/graduate-studies/bootcamp-physics-fundamentals-2020">Physics Bootcamp</a> for incoming graduate students at Yale, and taught the course for four summers both in-person and over Zoom. I am also a McDougal Teaching Fellow at the Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning, and am developing workshops on disability and belonging in the classroom. I also love outreach with students of all ages: I am a regular participant in Skype-a-Scientist, and served as the Graduate Coordinator for Yale Girls' Science Investigations for 4 years. Outside of physics, I enjoy hiking in the parks around New Haven, CT, and baking the most technically challenging things I can come up with (although my favorite projects are macarons).<p>
